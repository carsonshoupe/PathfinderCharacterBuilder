Link:(Ex):1: A druid can handle her animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if she doesn’t have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. The druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion.
Share Spells:(Ex):1: The druid may cast a spell with a target of “You” on her animal companion (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on herself. A druid may cast spells on her animal companion even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion’s type (animal). Spells cast in this way must come from a class that grants an animal companion. This ability does not allow the animal to share abilities that are not spells, even if they function like spells.
Evasion:(Ex):3: If an animal companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Ref lex save for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw. 
Ability Score Increase 1:(Ex):4: The animal companion adds +1 to one of its ability scores.
Ability Score Increase 2:(Ex):9: The animal companion adds +1 to one of its ability scores.
Ability Score Increase 3:(Ex):14: The animal companion adds +1 to one of its ability scores.
Ability Score Increase 4:(Ex):20: The animal companion adds +1 to one of its ability scores.
Devotion:(Ex):6: An animal companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects. 
Multiattack::9: An animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more natural attacks, the animal companion instead gains a second attack with one of its natural weapons, albeit at a –5 penalty.
Improved Evasion:(Ex):15: When subjected to an attack that allows a Ref lex saving throw for half damage, an animal companion takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the saving throw fails.
